# About

Hi, I'm Shuo Wang â€” 2 years of experience in AI/ML including large language models (LLM), natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and model development and deployment. I also have 8 years leading teams and managing Communicating and projects.
Currently seeking to transition into a Machine Learning Engineer or Data Science role.


# Featured Projects

## Very Intelligent Portfolio (Capstone Project)
- **Description:** Develope an open-source Transformer-based tool to optimize portfolio weights and recommend hedging strategies.  
- **Technologies Used:** Python (sklearn, pandas, numpy, seaborn), Amazon SageMaker, S3, Kubernetes, PyTorch, Azure, JupyterLab
- **Link:** https://very-intelligent-portfolio.github.io

## NLP Model for Toxic Comment Detection
- **Description:** Utilize advanced NLP techniques to build transformer-based models (including BART, BERT, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa) for toxic comment detection.  
- **Technologies Used:** Google Colab, TensorFlow, Neural Networks, Keras, Scikit-Learn
- **Link:** https://github.com/Shuo-Wang-UCBerkeley/Text-Classification

## DistilBERT API Deployment
- **Description:** Design and implement a FastAPI application to serve prediction of an NLP model using DistilBERT from HuggingFace for sentiment analysis. Orchestrate the deployment of the application in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).  
- **Technologies Used:** FastAPI, Docker, Azure, Kubernetes, Redis, Poetry, Istio, Kustomize, Grafana, CI/CD
- **Link:** https://github.com/Shuo-Wang-UCBerkeley/DistilBERT-API-Deployment

## Predicting Flight Delays
- **Description:** Predict departure delays greater than 15 minutes, 2 hours before takeoff
- **Technologies Used:** PySpark (ml, sql), Python (matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn, datetime), DataBricks, MapReduce
- **Link:** https://github.com/Shuo-Wang-UCBerkeley/FlightDelay

## Spotify Song Genre Prediction
- **Description:** Develop automated genre classification models and enhance user app experience. 
- **Technologies Used:** Kaggle, Python, Scikit-Learn, Keras
- **Link:** https://github.com/Shuo-Wang-UCBerkeley/Song-Genre

## Fashion MNIST Multi-Class Classification 
- **Description:** Develop Nerual Network model for Fashion MNIST images multi-class classification. 
- **Technologies Used:** Python, TensorFlow, Neural Networks

## Data Analysis and Engineering for a Hypothetical Restaurant 
- **Description:** Increase Acme Gourmet Meals brand awareness beyond the local Berkeley neighborhood by identifying top customers, calculating nearest BART station, and deploying pickup/delivery service. 
- **Technologies Used:** SQL, Neo4j, Relational Databases
- **Link:** https://github.com/Shuo-Wang-UCBerkeley/AGM-Brand

## CO2 Emissions Analysis 
- **Description:** Assess historical model (Keeling Curve) performance and project future CO2 concentrations
- **Technologies Used:** R (tidyverse, tsibble, forecast, ggplot), Python

## Voting Difficulty Analysis Project 
- **Description:** Evaluate which Party voters experience more difficulty voting in the 2020 Election.
    -   Led a statistical investigation into voter difficulties between Democratic and Republican voters during the 2020 U.S. election, utilizing the American National Election Studies data consisting of over 8,000 survey responses.
    -   Applied a non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test to rigorously compare voting difficulties.
    -   Defined a novel metric for voter difficulty that included both voters and those who intended but failed to vote, enhancing the breadth of the analysis.
    -   Applied a non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum test to rigorously compare voting difficulties.
    -   Identified a meaningful difference in difficulty levels that may influence election outcomes, advocating for targeted political strategies to alleviate voting barriers.
    
- **Technologies Used:** R (tidyverse, tsibble, forecast, ggplot), Python, Statistical Analysis, Wilcoxon Test
