# About

Hi, I'm Shuo Wang â€” 2 years of experience in AI/ML including large language models (LLM), natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and model development and deployment. I also have 8 years leading teams and managing Communicating and projects.
Currently seeking to transition into a Machine Learning Engineer or Data Science role.


# Featured Projects

## Very Intelligent Portfolio (Capstone Project)
- **Description:** Developed VIP, an open-source Transformer-based tool to optimize portfolio weights and recommend hedging strategies. VIP democratizes advanced investment techniques, empowering both employees with vested stock and retail investors to better manage their financial futures. 
- **Technologies Used:** Python (sklearn, pandas, numpy, seaborn), Amazon SageMaker, S3, Kubernetes, PyTorch, Azure, JupyterLab
- **Link:** https://very-intelligent-portfolio.github.io

## NLP Model for Toxic Comment Detection
- **Description:** Utilized advanced NLP techniques to build transformer-based models (including BART, BERT, DistilBERT, ALBERT, and RoBERTa) for toxic comment detection.  
- **Technologies Used:** Google Colab, TensorFlow, Neural Networks, Keras, Scikit-Learn
- **Link:** https://github.com/Shuo-Wang-UCBerkeley/Text-Classification

## DistilBERT API Deployment
- **Description:** Designed and implemented a FastAPI application to serve prediction of an NLP model using DistilBERT from HuggingFace for sentiment analysis. Orchestrated the deployment of the application in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).  
- **Technologies Used:** FastAPI, Docker, Azure, Kubernetes, Redis, Poetry, Istio, Kustomize, Grafana, CI/CD
- **Link:** https://github.com/Shuo-Wang-UCBerkeley/DistilBERT-API-Deployment

## Predicting Flight Delays
- **Description:** Predict departure delays greater than 15 minutes, 2 hours before takeoff
